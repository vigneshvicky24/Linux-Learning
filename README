1.INTRODUCTION TO LINUX

KERNEL
	The core of the OS. 
	The Linux kernel is what Linus Torvalds originally created. 
	It acts as a bridge between the applications and the hardware
SHELL:
	The Shell is a program that acts as the primary interface between the user and the Linux Kernel (the core of the operating system).
	 
PROCESS MANAGEMENT 
	It is the part of linux that creates,schedules,monitors and terminates programs,so the cpu ,memory,and systems resources are used efficiently


FILE SYSTEM

Directory,Purpose,Example
/	Root Directory: The base of the file system.,
/bin	"Binaries: Essential user command binaries (e.g., ls, cp).",
/etc	"Configuration Files: System-wide configuration files (e.g., networking settings).",
/home	"Home Directories: Contains personal files for regular users (e.g., /home/username).",
/var	"Variable Data: Files whose content is expected to change frequently (e.g., system logs, mail, print queues).",
/usr	"Unix System Resources: Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data, including applications and libraries.",
/dev	Devices: Contains special files representing hardware devices.,


File/Directory Operations
	ls-l	List files
	touch	create the file
	mkdir	create directory
	rm -f <filename>.txt	remove file
	rm <directory name>		remove directory
	cp <src path> <dest path>	copy file from one path to other path
	mv <src path> <dest path>	move file from one path to other path

File system metadata
	df -h	show disk usage
	mount /dev/sda1 /mnt 	Mount file system
	umount mnt 		umount /mnt
	fsck	file system 
	chmod 755 <filename>.sh		change File permission (4 - read,2-write,1-execute)
	   |
	   -->first position is "owner permission",second position "group permission" ,third position "other permission"
	chown user:group <filename>	change File ownership


2.LINUX DISTRIBUTION 

	-Debian - One of the oldest distro. Known for its rock-solid stability, adherence to free software principles, and long release cycles. Package manager is APT
	-Ubuntu - The most popular desktop and server distro. Built on Debian, it prioritizes user-friendliness, easy installation, and commercial support (from Canonical).
	-Linux - A highly user-friendly desktop distro based on Ubuntu. Aims for a familiar, elegant, "out-of-the-box" experience with pre-installed media codecs.
	-CentOS - It is redhat based on (Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL))
	-Alpine Linux - Extremely lightweight .Uses musl libs instead of glibc.Dominates Docker image.Package manger : apk(alpine package keeper) .alpine mainly used in the containerized the application

3.FILE OPERATIONS

Create:	
	touch <filename>.txt
	echo "hello" > test.txt
	mkdir <directory name>

Read:
	view or inspect file contents
		cat <filename>.txt
		less <filename>.txt
		head <filename>.txt
		tail <filename>.txt
		tail -f <filename>.txt 		//live output show 

Check the file detail
		ls -l
		stat README

locate files
		find ./ -name <fiename>.txt


grep - used for search text inside files
	grep "<search command to text>" <filename>.txt
	grep -i <filename>.txt (ignore case)
	grep -r "pattern" </path/to/> (recursive)
This is a must-have for log analysis


find - Search for files based on name, size, type, etc.
	find / -name "<filename>.txt
	find . -type f -size + 10M 
	find . -type d -name <directory_name>

awk- Pattern-based text processing + column extraction.
