LOG FILES
    log files are files that store system events and messages.
    Common log files in Linux are located in the /var/log directory.

    Some important log files:
        /var/log/syslog - General system log file
        /var/log/auth.log - Authentication logs
        /var/log/kern.log - Kernel logs
        /var/log/dmesg - Boot and hardware-related messages

    To view log files, you can use commands like:
        cat /var/log/syslog
        tail -f /var/log/auth.log
        less /var/log/kern.log

    You can also use tools like "journalctl" to view systemd logs:
        journalctl -xe

TROUBLESHOOTING:
Troubleshooting is the systematic process of identifying the cause of a problem or failure and implementing a solution.
    Common troubleshooting steps in Linux:
        1. Check system logs for errors.
        2. Verify network connectivity using ping or traceroute.
        3. Check disk space using df -h.
        4. Monitor system resources using top or htop.
        5. Restart services using systemctl restart <service_name>.
        6. Use strace to trace system calls and signals.
        7. Check for package updates and reinstall if necessary.

    Always refer to official documentation and community forums for specific issues.
