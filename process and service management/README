Process and service management is how Linux handles all the programs running on the system and the foundational services that keep the OS operational.

Process is an instance of running program.Eery process is tracked by the kernel and has a unique process ID (PID)

top - real time view of system performance,showing processes sorted by the cpu usage
kill - send signal to a process,typically used to terminate it. (kill -15 <pid> means gracefully ,kill -9 <pid> means forcefully kill)
killall - Kills all processes matching specific name 
niche/renice - Adjust priority nice used to set priority in the process,renice modifies the scheduling priority of the process.Lower niche means the higher priority



SERVICE MANAGEMENT 
    services are long running ,no interactive processes (like a web server or a database) that often start automatically at boot.
        systemctl status
        systemctl start
        systemctl stop
        systemctl restart
        systemctl enable (enable at boot)
        systemctl disable (disable at boot )
        systemctl list-units --type=service (to list all the services in the system)
