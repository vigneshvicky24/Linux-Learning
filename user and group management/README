User and group management is fundamental to Linux security and access control. Every file, directory, and process is owned by a specific user and a specific group. This system determines who can read, write, or execute resources.
To create new user 
    sudo useradd newuser

set or change password to the user
    sudo passwd <username>

Modifies an exiting user's details (changing their home and directory or adding them to group)
    sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>

To delete a user account, "-r" option to delete their home directory
    sudo userdel -r <newuser_name>

To see displays the UID and group membership of a user
    id <username_name>


SUDO 

sudo is short form for the "super user do" allows to permitted user to execute a command as the root user or another user,as defined by the system's security policy.
(In simple word run this command with the administrative power)
